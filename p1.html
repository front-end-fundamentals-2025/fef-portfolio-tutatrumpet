            For this project, the goal was to create a unique selfie using
            JavaScript. I really like the artstyle of southpark so I wanted to
            take inspiration from that. The first thing I did was looking at
            diffrent characters form the show and pointed out features that were
            common in most of the characters.This project was a great
            opportunity to explore dynamic styling and visual creativity with
            code.
